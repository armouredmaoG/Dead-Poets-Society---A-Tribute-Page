        <div id="tribute-info">
            <p id="description">The "Dead Poets Society" was a secret club Mr. Keating was part of during his own time as a student at Welton Academy. The society's philosophy centers on embracing the beauty of poetry, encouraging free thinking, and challenging the status quo.<br/><br/>
            The students in the society express themselves creatively, and seek deeper meaning in their lives.<br/><br/> “Suck the marrow out of life” ― they believed.</p>
